30R 7/28/1991 was missing eddy8kto25k (eddyabove25k was entered twice)
30R 10/17/1992 was missing eddy8kto25k (eddyabove25k was entered twice)
30R 10/17/1992 was missing eddyminto8k 
62R 5/9/2005 has binvol files for eddy8kto25k and eddyabove25k but no entries in lookup table
62R mismatch between lookup table and binvol files. 2/9/2008 in lookup table. chan, eddy8-25, and eddymin had 2/8/2008 in filenames.
65R mismatch between lookup table and binvol files. 9/15/2000 in lookup table. 20000911 in binvol files.

 There were no zero value files for the reattachment bar at nautiloid for 2015.  I added those files.  The 2015 survey date for 22R is listed as 9/25 (in binvol files and lookup table) while the date for 24L is 9/24. One of those has to be wrong, and I'm pretty sure it would be 22-mile. On both of those, make appropriate notes and file name corrections so those errors don't happen again.  Date_Error_lookup.xlsx is the current version of the full error and trip date lookup table. Please delete or move to an archive folder any previous versions.

I didn't use the "channel" data at all yet. These are notes on what I did with the "eddy" data.

1) corrected values for Redwall for 2015 with values Rob supplied.
2) data for abv25k bin for 29L (was missing). Added values Rob supplied.
3) all the reattachment bar sites that had missing values when they should be zeros (I think). I added zero values. used "estimated" tag.
4) separation bar at 50r had no data for Feb. 2008. estimated with values from previous survey. used "estimated" tag.
5) 56r had no data for Feb. 2008. estimated with values from previous survey. used "estimated" tag.

I noticed the following other issues that I didn't resolve.
1) Redwall: 2015 value is pretty small. Is this correct?
2) 51L has 62R data
3) 91R inconsistent between 8-25 and abv25 bins (8-25k data missing for 9/29/03)
4)  62R has bad 1993 data  (or was volume really 13000 m^3 in 1993 then 300 m^3 in 1994?)
5) 172 has zero values for >25k bin in 2003
6) 225 has problem with June 2008 (values way too low). Also has zero values in >25k bin in 1991 and 1992.
7) Also for 29L there are data for 5/6/2002 for abv.25k bin, but not for 8-25k bin. 5/6/2002 is not in lookup table.
